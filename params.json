{"name":"Flag Wars","tagline":"Online deck generator for a playing card game","body":"Flag Wars\r\n=========\r\n\r\nFlag Wars (*lipukaardid* in Estonian) was a fairly popular game in parts of\r\nSoviet Estonia. As such cards were not produced by any Soviet manufacturer, and\r\ncolour printing was not easily available to the general public, kids drew the\r\ncards themselves. Some even cut flags out of books and glued them on.\r\n\r\nMy own hand-drawn set, from around 1992:\r\n\r\n![Hand-drawn deck](img/th_handmade.jpg)\r\n\r\nPrint-ready HTML generated from Wikipedia data, 2014:\r\n\r\n![Printable deck](img/th_generated.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nGameplay\r\n--------\r\n\r\nIn general, very similar to [War](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_(card_game)).\r\n\r\n**Play:** Shuffle and deal all cards. Player next to dealer leads the first round.\r\n\r\n**Each round:** Leader announces a field from their topmost card. \r\nPlayer with the best score puts the trick under their deck and leads the next round. \r\nIf a player's card has no value in chosen field, leader must choose another field.\r\n\r\n**Compare:** Higher numbers are better, except for obesity rate.\r\nIf best values are equal, tied players include their next card.\r\n\r\n**Endgame:** With 3 cards or less, player can choose which card to use.\r\n\r\n**Game over:** When one player loses all cards. Or when last player remains.\r\n\r\n\r\nGenerating\r\n----------\r\n\r\nGenerator is a single stand-alone HTML page, using embedded JavaScript to \r\nretrieve the country list from Wikipedia and make a number of separate\r\nqueries to assemble card data: reading statistics from country and capital\r\npages, counting colours in flag and coat-of-arms images.\r\n\r\nWhen generating is complete, the resulting deck can be printed immediately,\r\nor saved to a file on your computer. File can be saved with embedded images,\r\nmaking it completely stand-alone and not dependent on online Wikipedia.\r\n\r\nThe number of flag/heraldic colours is blindly parsed from SVG image data,\r\ncounting every colour value from image vector attributes. As some image vectors\r\nare crafted quite intricately, numbers can get absurdly large.\r\n\r\nWorks best in Chrome and Firefox. Printing is crude in Safari and Opera;\r\nInternet Explorer has poor performance in general.\r\n\r\n\r\nAttribution\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nCard generator uses jQuery, http://jquery.com.\r\n\r\nImages and most data from Wikipedia.\r\n\r\nObesity data from CIA World Factbook 2008,\r\nhttps://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/.\r\n\r\nObesity data for Estonia from \"Obesity, impaired glucose regulation, metabolic \r\nsyndrome and their associations with high-molecular-weight adiponectin levels\" \r\nby Triin Eglit, 2014-02-14, http://dspace.utlib.ee/dspace/handle/10062/37323.\r\n\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n-------\r\n\r\nThe MIT License\r\nCopyright (C) 2014 by Erki Suurjaak\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\r\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\r\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\r\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\r\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\r\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\r\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nThe software is provided \"as is\", without warranty of any kind, express or\r\nimplied, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability,\r\nfitness for a particular purpose and noninfringement.
